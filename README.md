# Google Flight Price Scraper ✈️

This repository contains a Python-based scraper designed to track and extract flight prices from Google Flights. By leveraging the power of Selenium and proxy rotation, the scraper automates the process of fetching flight details such as prices, departure times, and more, saving the data into a CSV file for easy analysis.

## 📖 Tutorial Reference

This project is based on the tutorial published on Rayobyte's community blog and video tutorial:

- [**YouTube Video Tutorial**](https://youtu.be/8LZXeI7_OxE)

Refer to the tutorial for a detailed explanation of how the scraper works, setup instructions, and customization tips.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Flight Price Tracking**: Scrapes flight details (e.g., price, time) from Google Flights based on user-defined search criteria.
- **Dynamic Proxy Rotation**: Integrates proxy services for seamless and anonymous scraping.
- **Data Storage**: Saves flight details to a CSV file for easy tracking and analysis.

   if __name__ == "__main__":
   one_way_url = FlightURLBuilder.build_url(
       departure="SFO",
       destination="LAX",
       departure_date="2024-12-25"
   )
   print("One-way URL:", one_way_url)

   # Run the scraper
